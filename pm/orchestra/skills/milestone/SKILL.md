# Milestone Review

Read the active milestone PRD, compare its materials table against actual repo state, and surface what needs attention.

## Steps

### 1. Find the Active Milestone

- Read `.orchestra/roadmap.md`
- Parse the materials table
- Find the first milestone with status "In Progress" or "Not Started"
- If $ARGUMENTS specifies a milestone name, use that instead
- Read the milestone's PRD at the path in the materials table

### 2. Audit the Materials Table

For each row in the milestone PRD's materials table:

**If location is a file path:**
- Check if the file exists
- If it exists, read it and assess completeness
- Compare actual state to the status column — flag mismatches

**If location is a ClickUp link:**
- Note it for the user (don't fetch unless clickup skills are installed)

**If status is "Done":**
- Verify the deliverable actually exists and looks complete

**If status is "Not Started" or "Needs Refresh":**
- This is a gap — candidate for new work

### 3. Present the Review

```
## Milestone Review: {milestone name}

**Objective:** {from PRD}
**Progress:** {N}/{M} deliverables done

### Gaps (work needed)
| Material | Status | Issue |
|----------|--------|-------|
| {name} | Not Started | {why it matters} |
| {name} | Needs Refresh | {what changed since last version} |

### Stale (status says done but reality differs)
| Material | Claimed | Actual |
|----------|---------|--------|
| {name} | Done | {what's actually wrong} |

### On Track
| Material | Status |
|----------|--------|
| {name} | Done |
| {name} | In Progress |

### Recommended Next Actions
1. {highest priority gap — why}
2. {second priority — why}
3. {third — why}
```

### 4. Propose Work

For each gap, suggest whether it needs:
- A **PRD** (if scope is unclear or multi-deliverable)
- A **spec** (if approach needs defining)
- A **ticket** (if ready to execute)
- **Direct work** (if small enough to just do)

## Rules

- Read-only — don't modify any files
- Be honest about mismatches — if status says "Done" but the file is empty, flag it
- Trace everything back to the roadmap — gaps should connect to the milestone objective
